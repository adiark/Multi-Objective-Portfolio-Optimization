# Portfolio Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms - GitHub Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the research and implementation of an innovative approach to portfolio optimization using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The project focuses on optimizing a portfolio of the top 50 stocks from the S&P 500, leveraging data from Yahoo Finance. The key innovation lies in a three-stage optimization process, integrating advanced computational techniques with financial portfolio management.
